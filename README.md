## 👋 Hi there, I'm LiorShine

I'm a web developer who writes code that *sometimes* works — and always looks cool doing it. I believe clean code is like a good joke: it shouldn’t need an explanation. (Though let’s be honest, mine still needs a few footnotes 😅)

Currently, I'm building full-stack web applications using technologies like React, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. I'm particularly interested in authentication flows using NextAuth, styling with shadcn/ui, and experimenting with tRPC and other tools that have way too many acronyms.

I don’t have a ton of public repos yet — I’m still exploring, experimenting, and learning one project at a time.  
By day I ship features. By night I fix bugs. Often the ones I introduced earlier that day.

I'm also learning to write cleaner architecture, more reusable UI components, and maybe — just maybe — documentation that actually makes sense.

If you like what you see, drop a ⭐ on one of my repos — it makes my day 10x better.
